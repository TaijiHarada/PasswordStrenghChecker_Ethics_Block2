# PasswordStrenghChecker_Ethics_Block2
Matlab code to determine the strength of a password.

Summary: This code reads a user inputed password and determines its
% strength based on a very simple algorithm.

To run this program, simply open the .m file in matlab and click the run button.
You will be asked to enter a password in the command window and results will be
output to the command window.

Limitations: â€œThis tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing sensitive information

Etical considerations: It would be very hard to use a passwordStrengthChecker for malicious intentions.
However, this very simple alogrithm only accounts for length of password and character type.
It does not account for any other paramaters like common passwords (12345) or birthdates.
So, this may give a user false security, because a password containing many digits will be considered
strong even if all the number are in order like "123456789".
